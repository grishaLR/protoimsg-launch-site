        protoimsg exists to be a safe space for all people. We will aggressively ban
        and moderate any form of hate speech, threatening, and stalking.
        That's not a footnote. It's the foundation.

        Every feature, moderation tool, and privacy boundary is designed with the most
        vulnerable users in mind first.
